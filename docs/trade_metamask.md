The HydraDX chain supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). You can use your 0x address with MetaMask and/or Ledger to perform any on-chain action such as trading in the Omnipool or placing a trustless over-the-counter order.

The accepted currency for gas fees is **WETH (Moonbeam)**.

The easiest way to onboard assets from the Ethereum network into your MetaMask HydraDX account is to [bridge them to the Moonbeam network](https://www.carrier.so/).

Once you have the assets on the Moonbeam network, you can easily transfer them to the HydraDX chain using the guide below.

## Step-by-step
To onboard assets from Moonbeam to HydraDX:

1. Navigate to the [HydraDX cross-chain UI](https://app.hydradx.io/cross-chain)
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet and accept changing network to HydraDX
3. Select as source chain `Moonbeam`
4. Select the asset you want to transfer and the amount
5. Transfer and sign using your MetaMask wallet
